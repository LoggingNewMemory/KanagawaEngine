Design of Kanagawa Engine

This engine supposed to modify how the CPU works (See the drawio file for how it works)
Targets is to embed it to Android Roms (By giving proper binary & SELinux context)
That hopefully could run rootless (and should be) - Therefore the design is on initial work meaning
More feature or revision will come in the future
